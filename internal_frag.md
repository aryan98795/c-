### üì¶ Internal Fragmentation ‚Äì Explained Simply

---

### üìå Definition:

> **Internal fragmentation** occurs when **allocated memory** is **larger than what is actually needed**, leading to **wasted space inside** an allocated memory block.

---

### üß† Example:

Suppose a process needs **18 bytes**, but the memory allocator gives it a **block of 20 bytes** (smallest available block).
‚û°Ô∏è The extra **2 bytes are wasted internally** ‚Äî that‚Äôs **internal fragmentation**.

---

### üìö Real-Life Analogy:

Imagine you book a hotel room (memory block) with a **minimum room size of 2 beds**, but you‚Äôre just **one person**.

* The **extra bed is unused** ‚ûù that‚Äôs internal fragmentation.
* You paid for the room but **can't use 100% of it.**

### üßÆ Why Does It Happen?

It usually arises due to:

| Cause                            | Example                                             |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fixed-size memory blocks**     | Memory blocks of size 32B, 64B, etc.                |
| **Alignment constraints**        | E.g., 4-byte alignment may waste some bytes         |
| **Page-based memory allocation** | A program using only 2 KB may still get a 4 KB page |

### üîß Contrast with **External Fragmentation**:

| Internal Fragmentation              | External Fragmentation                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Wasted **within** allocated block   | Wasted **outside** allocated blocks                    |
| Happens with **fixed-size** blocks  | Happens with **variable-size** blocks                  |
| Easy to calculate                   | Harder to manage                                       |
| Eg: Given 100B block, only 90B used | Eg: Free memory is 100B but scattered into small holes |

### üß† Visualization:

```
Memory Block Allocated: [____________________]
Actual Used:            [__________          ]
Wasted Space:                  ‚Üë‚Üë‚Üë‚Üë‚Üë‚Üë‚Üë‚Üë‚Üë
                            Internal Fragmentation
```

---

### ‚úÖ How to Reduce It?

* Use **variable-size blocks** (more complex, leads to external fragmentation though).
* Use **slab allocation** (for objects of same size).
* Optimize **memory allocator** to match sizes closely.
* Group allocations by **object size class** (e.g., 8B, 16B, 32B pools).
