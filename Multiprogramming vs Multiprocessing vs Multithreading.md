Here is a clear and concise **comparison table** showing the difference between **Multiprogramming**, **Multiprocessing**, and **Multithreading** in Operating Systems:

### âœ… Multiprogramming vs Multiprocessing vs Multithreading

| Feature               | **Multiprogramming**                             | **Multiprocessing**                     | **Multithreading**                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**        | Multiple programs in memory at once (1 CPU)      | Multiple CPUs working together          | Multiple threads within a single process         |
| **Goal**              | Maximize **CPU utilization**                     | Maximize **throughput and parallelism** | Improve performance via **concurrent execution** |
| **Execution Units**   | Programs                                         | Processes                               | Threads (lightweight processes)                  |
| **CPU Count**         | Single CPU                                       | Two or more CPUs/cores                  | One or more threads on single/multiple cores     |
| **Context Switching** | Between processes (slower)                       | Between processes (can be slow)         | Between threads (faster)                         |
| **Memory Space**      | Each program has separate memory                 | Each process has separate memory        | Threads share the same memory                    |
| **Isolation**         | Strong                                           | Strong                                  | Weak (threads can affect each other)             |
| **Communication**     | Complex (e.g., via OS or files)                  | Complex (IPC required)                  | Easy (shared memory)                             |
| **Example**           | Running editor + browser + compiler sequentially | Multi-core CPU running multiple apps    | Web browser with UI thread + download thread     |
| **Main Use Case**     | Better CPU usage when waiting for I/O            | Parallel computation                    | Responsive & efficient multitasking in one app   |

### ðŸ§  Real-World Analogy

| Concept          | Analogy                                                               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Multiprogramming | One cook cooking dishes **one by one**, but keeps multiple pans ready |
| Multiprocessing  | **Multiple cooks** cooking in parallel                                |
| Multithreading   | One cook doing **multiple tasks** simultaneously (boiling + chopping) |
