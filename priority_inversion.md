### ✅ **Priority Inversion** – Simple Explanation

**Priority Inversion** happens when:

> A **low-priority task** holds a resource (like a mutex) that a **high-priority task** needs, but the **low-priority task can't run** because a **medium-priority task** is hogging the CPU.

---

### 🔹 Real-World Analogy:

* Low-priority person (L) is using a shared printer.
* High-priority person (H) is waiting to use the printer.
* But Medium-priority person (M) keeps talking to the CPU.
* So H waits... even though H is the most important. ❌

---

### 🔹 Technical Flow:

1. Low-priority task **locks a mutex**.
2. High-priority task gets ready, wants that mutex — **gets blocked**.
3. Medium-priority task runs (since L is low and H is blocked).
4. **L never resumes → H starves**.

This is **inversion** — H is lower than M, even though it's highest.

---

### 🔹 Example (Pseudocode):

```c
// Low priority task
void lowTask() {
    lock(mutex);      // holds resource
    delay(100);       // simulating work
    unlock(mutex);
}

// High priority task
void highTask() {
    lock(mutex);      // wants mutex, but blocked
    // ...
}

// Medium priority task
void mediumTask() {
    // keeps preempting lowTask
}
```

---

### 🔹 Solution: **Priority Inheritance**

* If low-priority task is **blocking a higher one**, temporarily **boost its priority**.
* So low-priority task finishes faster → releases resource → high-priority resumes.

---

### 🔹 OS that handle it:

* RTOS like **FreeRTOS**, **VxWorks**, **RTEMS**, etc.
* Modern OS kernels also have mitigation techniques (Linux RT patch, Windows CE, etc.)
