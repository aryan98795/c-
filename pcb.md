| Component                  | Description                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Process ID (PID)**       | Unique identifier for the process                 |
| **Process State**          | Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated, etc.         |
| **Program Counter (PC)**   | Address of the next instruction to execute        |
| **CPU Registers**          | Saved CPU register values (for context switching) |
| **Memory Management Info** | Page tables, segment tables, base/limit registers |
| **Accounting Info**        | CPU time used, priority, limits, etc.             |
| **I/O Status Info**        | List of open files, I/O devices allocated         |
| **Parent/Child Info**      | Parent PID, child processes                       |
| **Scheduling Info**        | Priority, queue pointers                          |
