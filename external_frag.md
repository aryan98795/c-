### üåê External Fragmentation ‚Äì Explained Clearly

---

### üìå Definition:

> **External fragmentation** occurs when **free memory** is available in total, but **not in a single contiguous block**, making it **unusable for large allocations**.

---

### üìö Real-Life Analogy:

Imagine you have **multiple empty desks** scattered across an office, but you need a **big table for a team meeting**.
Even though the **total desk space is enough**, there‚Äôs **no single large table** available.

‚û°Ô∏è That‚Äôs **external fragmentation**.

---

### üß† Example:

You have the following free memory blocks:

```
[10KB]   [6KB]   [3KB]   [8KB]
```

You want to allocate a process needing **15KB**.
‚û°Ô∏è **Total free = 27KB**, but **no single block ‚â• 15KB**
‚û°Ô∏è **Cannot allocate ‚Üí External Fragmentation**

---

### üîç When Does It Occur?

* Happens in **dynamic memory allocation** when memory is allocated and freed **non-contiguously**.
* Common in **variable-size partitions** (e.g., malloc/free in C, heap allocators).

### üîß Contrast with Internal Fragmentation:

| Feature             | Internal Fragmentation      | External Fragmentation                            |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Wasted memory is... | Inside allocated blocks     | Outside, between allocations                      |
| Block size type     | Fixed-size                  | Variable-size                                     |
| Visibility          | Not externally visible      | Visible in memory map                             |
| Example             | Allocated 64B but using 50B | Multiple free blocks not enough for large request |

---

### üßÆ Visual Representation:

```
Memory:   [Used][Free 10KB][Used][Free 5KB][Used][Free 6KB]

Request:  Need 18KB

‚Üí Cannot fulfill request even though total free = 21KB
‚Üí External Fragmentation
```

### ‚úÖ Solutions to External Fragmentation

| Technique                    | Description                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compaction**               | Move processes to combine free blocks (requires overhead)                 |
| **Paging**                   | Divide memory into fixed-size pages (removes external fragmentation)      |
| **Segmentation with paging** | Combine segmentation flexibility with paging efficiency                   |
| **Buddy Allocator**          | Use power-of-two block sizes to manage merging/freeing memory efficiently |

---

### üìå In OS Terms:

* **External fragmentation** is one reason modern OSs prefer **paging** or **segmentation + paging**, since they **eliminate or reduce** fragmentation problems.
